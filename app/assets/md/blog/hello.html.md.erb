# Hi, I'm Bud! Your C# build tool!

Bud is your friendly C# neighbourhood build tool. Bud defines and manages C# projects for you. He automates all kinds
of tasks around those projects. For example, Bud will fetch remote dependencies, build your projects, run tests,
and publish your projects for others to consume. Bud is designed to fit nicely into all kinds of continuous integration
tasks. You can teach Bud new tricks too. You can either write your own tasks directly in C# or use tasks that other
Bud users have written and published.

Take a look at [the guide](/Docs/Guide) to start using Bud or [the outline](Docs/Outline) to learn more.

## Bud's mission

Bud will do his best to remove all the pain from building and automating .NET projects. Bud will improve
developers' daily work as well as a project's continuous integration, deployment, documentation, and
customer delivery.

Bud is aware how important it is to make build processes as simple, consistent, reliable, and swift
as possible. Teams should not loose time with the build and they should be able to quickly integrate
each-other's projects (either at the level of sources or published artifacts). Releases should be
quick and simple too.

In short, Bud's goal is to bring .NET project automation to the next level.

## Bud's story

Before Bud was released into the wilds of The .NET Build Land, he travelled the world and met many wonderful
build friends. A long time ago, he travelled to the savannas of the GNU where he met and worked with the
Autotools family for a couple of years.

Bud then ventured forth to the to the country of JVM. There he first
entered the fields of Java, where he worked with the great Ant and listened to the revolutionary ideas of Maven.
Also in the JVM country, Bud visited the city of Scala, where he met SBT (a cousin of Maven). Bud learned
from SBT that it is important to allow developers to customise the build with their own tasks and that a type
system can help them quite a bit.

Afterwards (still in the country of JVM), Bud stumbled upon Clojure, a beautiful valley enclosed by a
wonderfully symmetric system of semi-circular mountain ranges. There Bud met Leiningen, who told epic
stories about his battles with Ant and his project-preparation powers. Just like SBT, Leiningen told
Bud how important it is to empower developers with the ability to customise the build with new tasks
and quickly test them. Bud learned a lot again.

Not far from Clojure valley, Bud entered the groves of Groovy, a fairly tranquil place. Gradle lives
there, a very powerful builder of webs, desktop stuff, and Androids. Bud was amazed at Gradle's
versatility.

Soon after, in the gem-rich caves of Ruby, Bud visited Bundler and Rake, a truly harmonious duo. Bud
studied their ways and perhaps the most astounding discovery was that Bundler would do work only every
now and then, while Rake would work overtime (even during deployment and the operation of the built
project). Rake would tell Bud about Rails and how she manages Rails' lifecycle, processes its assets,
migrates its databases, and many other wondrous tasks. Bud decided that it would strive to be as powerful
as Rake.

Bud also visited the JavaScript jungle, where he met the NPM, Bower, Gulp, and ???. Bud noticed how
extremely quick startup of the build and even faster execution times spread joy and happiness amongst
developers. Bud decided he'll spread such joy himself.

In short, Bud made friends with many wise build tools in his lifetime. He decided it's now time for
him to contribute back to the .NET ecosystem.
