# Hi, I'm Bud! Your C# build tool!

Bud is your friendly C# neighbourhood build tool. Bud defines and manages C# projects for you. He automates all kinds
of tasks around those projects. For example, Bud will fetch remote dependencies, build your projects, run tests,
and publish your projects for others to consume. You can teach Bud new tricks too. You can either write your own tasks
directly in C# or use tasks that others have written and published.

## Bud's story

Bud's journey started in the savannas of the GNU. There he met Autotools, a large and well known family of
makers and configurators. Bud lived with the family for some years. He learned a lot from them. One of the
things they taught him was to always verify the assumptions you have about the environment before embarking
on any building in the savannah. If the environment does not match your assumptions, you should notify the
masters and ask them to fix the environment first. After all, only the masters should manipulate the
environment.

Bud was particularly interested in how the work is distributed within the family. First, there is the Aclocal tool,
which prepares the build ground and places some of her brothers and sisters into right positions.

- highly configurable
- supported on multiple platforms
- geared towards

It took Bud a long time to get to know every member of the Autotools family.
 
He then ventured forth to the to the JVM country. He first
stumbled onto the fields of Java, where he worked with the great Ant and listened to the revolutionary ideas of Maven.
Also in the JVM country, Bud visited the city of Scala, where he met SBT, a cousin of Maven, who talked about the
benefits of a type system for organising one's work.

, and Leiningen, caves of Ruby, nests of Python, and the JavaScript jungle.
Bud met many wise build tools in those lands. He worked with them, learned fromm them, and argued about difficult topics
with them. Bud also picked up a lot of cool tricks from them. In short, He made a lot of good friends.

Bud's first acquaintances were a family called Autotools from the land of GNU. They told him stories about 

Maven, for
example, who lives in Java, told Bud about the importance of a good project structure and the benefits of a folder
layout that matches build targets. Maven also told him about   
Maven told Bud stories about folder structure and build target., SBT, Rake, and Gulp.
