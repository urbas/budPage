# Introduction

Bud is a build tool. You can define your C# projects with it and Bud will fetch your
projects' dependencies, build, run, test, package, and publish them for you. Bud
is highly customisable too. For example, you can define your own build- and release-cycle
tasks right in your build definition.

Bud is both a command line tool as well as a library. On the one hand, you can use it
to automate build tasks for your .NET projects. On the other hand, you can use it to
query information about projects and programmatically execute tasks from your .NET
applications.
